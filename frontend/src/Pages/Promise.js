If your car is disabled and you have either the National Service Warranty ("Coast to Coast") or Tire Protection Plan ("Freedom Plan") and you can't find one of the 30,000 service stations within 25 milesâ€¦we'll give you $250!

Obviously, we're pretty confident in our warranty package and our network of 30,000 dealers. We hope you never have to use either one of our warranties, but it's nice to know you have a partner by your back. Nobody protects you like the Pros. Nobody.
